<p class="md20 sm19 xs19 mt6 lh140">We are at a <b>very critical time in Internet Marketing</b> where sales from normal, 
average advertising strategies are going DOWN like a lead balloon.<br><br>

<b>Visual and fast, quirky content</b> is now what tends to <b>appeal to the audience’s (or our) emotions,</b> which, in the wake of the information and connective generation, we are becoming more in tune with. <br><br>

This ‘meme’ style advertising is now evoking a range of feelings that increase the likelihood of success against old Marketing jargon and spiels. <br><br>

People are too smart now to listen to your old chatty ads with happy families and static boring imagery on them. <br><br>

<span class="w600 underline">They want your pitch fast</span> and they want it summed up in a way that pleases them, not puts them to sleep or irritates them. <br><br>

You see, we live in a world of media, of next generation animation and fast paced living – a thousand words used to be summed up in a drawing, art work or

That’s right – welcome to the <b>Internet Age of communication.</b> <br><br>

People are not writing to each other anymore (like they used to even a few short years ago), or posting long scripts and opinions… they are GRABBING people’s attention or conveying how they feel with <span class="w600 underline">short, funny, poignant or hard hitting video clips called GIFS.</span><br><br>

The human mind has evolved. We are all, whether you know it or not, getting FASTER, quicker, taking in more information and boring more easily. <br><br> 

In a world of <span class="yellow1 w600">convenience,</span> where people <span class="yellow1 w600">want you to get to the point</span> so they can carry on with their busy day, more and more people are finding new and more modern ways to <span class="yellow1 w600">interact and share</span> in much more creative and entertaining ways. <br><br>

If you are a <span class="yellow1 w600">current Internet Marketer,</span> I won’t have to define a GIF for you … you’ll just know because it is all around you in both personal and business terms.<br> 
But if you have been around a long time and are just stumbling upon this <span class="yellow1 w600">new age method of conveying brands, selling products and expressing moods</span> to others, then you might ask – “What exactly is a GIF, then?”

<p class="md20 sm19 xs19 mt6 lh140">GIFs are image files that are compressed to reduce transfer time. <b>This makes it easy to send pictures</b> and ready-made (or self-created) memes to others via social 
media without waiting a million years. <br><br>

<b>In essence, that’s the usual benefits.</b> <br><br>

Smaller file size means <b>no time wasting and no ‘failed to send’</b> messages or ‘file 
too big’.   <br><br>

An animated GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) on the other hand is even <b>funkier.</b> <br><br>
It is a graphic image on a Web page that moves - for example, a twirling icon or a banner with a hand that waves, a guy that body pops (on a loop) or letters that 
magically get larger.<br><br>
Below are some examples of generic GIFS that have been sent to me via <b>social 
media sites</b> (including Facebook groups and Whatsapp groups too!) and across 
<b>webpages, popups, blog content and advertising for businesses.</b>

<b>It really is an awesome and attention grabbing marketing tool too, because it conveys reactions 
perfectly without saying much.</b> <br><br>

Plus, they can be pretty hilarious, and you know what … funny relaxes people, and <b>relaxed people buy more.</b> <br><br>

<li>They can be tailored to your brand, product, service or message 
<li>They can be made to be very funny and targeted so that people get the ‘in-joke’

</div>

<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 mt2">
<ul class="md20 sm19 xs19 benefitul1">
<li>GIFs are easy to consume and this makes them very attractive to any brand trying to meet the 
audience’s content needs. According to Twitter, people shared more than 100 million GIFs in 2023 through tweets and direct messages and we are not expecting this number to reduce this year. <span class="blue w600">(ClickZ, https://www.clickz.com)</span>

<li>GIF animation is really simple to work with for social media marketing and instantly plays in most Web browsers today. <span class="blue w600">(Onlim, http://onlim.com) </span>

<li>According to Statistic Brain’s Study, the average attention span for reading an email in 2023 was just 8.25 seconds. GIFs have the power to hold readers longer than words can, particularly in a pile of 
hundreds of other emails fighting for attention. <span class="blue w600">(Izea, https://izea.com) 
</span>
<li>A study by Marketing Sherpa has shown that campaign results get considerably improvised by the usage of Animated GIFs in emails, besides leading to more subscriber engagement. For instance, 
technology giant Dell saw a 109% increase in conversions using email GIF. <span class="blue w600">(Email Monks, http://www.emailmonks.com) </span>

<li>Compared with photos, GIFs are more appealing and more effective in Social Media strategy and compared with videos, it takes less time to create them and they are cheaper and easier to make. 
Currently, GIF type of the format is shared more than JPEG or PNG format, according to the stats from W3tech. <span class="blue w600">(Digital Doughnut, https://www.digitaldoughnut.com) </span>

<li>Tumblr, the blogging site, said it had 23 million GIFs posted to its site every day. In March, Facebook began supporting GIFs, with more than five million of the animations sent daily through its messaging app. <span class="blue w600">(The New York Times, https://www.nytimes.com) </span>

<li>1 in 2 marketers use animated gifs in their email campaigns, according to the Experian Email Market Study. <span class="blue w600">(Sales Force, https://www.salesforce.com).</span>

<li>Supported by most of the major email clients (except Outlook 2007/2010 and Windows Mobile 7), GIFs are a compelling and obvious way for email marketers to be relevant, engage customers, and 
increase click through rates. <span class="blue w600">(TNW, https://thenextweb.com)</span>

<li>As GIFs only last a few seconds, their file size is significantly smaller and the process of uploading them is faster comparing to videos, while the auto loop increases the effectiveness of a brand’s message. <span class="blue w600">(ClickZ, https://www.clickz.com)</span>

<li>A survey conducted by Bluefly indicates that animated GIFs can increase CTRs by 5 per cent and the overall revenue by 12 per cent. In another survey carried out by Marketing Sherpa on behalf of Dell, it showed 42% increase in CTR and increase in revenue by over 100%. <span class="blue w600">(Clip Tap Convert, http://clicktapconvert.com) </span>

<li>Websites and blogs are now looking at how the GIF can enrich the visitor experience and encourage them to share their content. Many are taking inspiration from BuzzFeed and sites from the Gawker 
network, which are already using GIF imagery to drive more traffic and create more interest. <span class="blue w600">(Lifewire, https://www.lifewire.com)</span>

<li>GIFs create an interest just for the sake of having a “play” button on them. They tell a story in just some seconds, and users feel attracted by it. GIFs are a sign of creativity: everybody can create his or her own customized GIF. They can go viral, as they are so varied and are so easy to create and share. Also, they can work as a call to action to launch costless campaigns.  <span class="blue w600">(Internet Republica, http://internetrepublica.com)</span>

<li>According to Twitter statistics, users shared 100 million GIFs in 2023. It means that GIF feature is an essential part of delivering the campaign’s message and content. Thus, it’s an essential part of 2025 social media marketing strategy. <span class="blue w600">(Marketing Insider Group, https://marketinginsidergroup.com)</span>

<li>Trends and data presentation also look good in the GIF format. Many experts started to utilize GIFs to present trends and other graphical data. <span class="blue w600">(M2Social, http://www.m2social.net)</span>

<li>The major benefit of GIF marketing is that brands can instantly get across tone, emotion and 
meaning. Successful marketers will always play towards people’s emotions – eliciting a response from them can mean the difference between a sale or not. Using GIFs in marketing will typically result in the end user feeling happy or amused. This immediate positive reinforcement by a brand helps establish a connection between the individual and a brand far quicker than a bunch of words. <span class="blue w600">(Comms Axis, https://www.commsaxis.com) </span>

It also allows you to upload your own series of images to achieve the same thing rather than just using a YouTube video.<br><br> 

You can also get screenshots from your own mp4 videos…<br><br>

Everything is so easy!
